I'm Jet, a freshman at Wayland High School. I don't have that many hobbies, because I spend most of my time doing math.
I also spend a lot of time on the forums of
https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/329020">Art of Problem Solving. I like doing math stuff and putting off doing school stuff

This blog is to keep track of any cool math problems I come across, as well as any math related experiences I have.
