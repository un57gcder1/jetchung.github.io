This post will be a collection of some interesting results in vector geometry.

1. Show that the four medians of a tetrahedron concur.

This problem can be solved using vectors. Let $$M_i$$ denote the centroid on the face opposite of vertex $$i$$. Also, denote by $$X$$ the midpoint of $$BC$$. Therefore, since $$M_a \in DX$$ and $$M_d \in AX$$, we know that $$AM_a$$ and $$DM_d$$ must intersect at some point $$P$$. Our goal will be to show that this point $$P$$ divides $$AM_a$$ and $$DM_d$$ in a fixed ratio, as this will show all medians intersect at $$P$$.

Let $$\frac{\left|\overrightarrow{AP}|\right}{$$\left|\overrightarrow{PM_a}\right$$
