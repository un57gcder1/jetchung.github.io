Let $$a$$, $$b$$, $$c$$ be three distinct integers, and let $$P$$ be a polynomial with integer
coefficients. Show that in this case the conditions $$P(a) = b$$, $$P(b) = c$$, $$P(c) = a$$ cannot be satisfied simultaneously.

Proof: we will use the fact that $$x-y$$|$$P(x)-P(y)$$

We have:

$$ a-b|P(a)-P(b) = b-c \\ 
 b-c|P(b)-P(c) = c-a \\ 
 c-a|P(c)-P(a) = a-b \\ $$



Thus, $$a-b | b-c | c-a | a-b \rightarrow a-b | b-c| a-b$$, so by symmetry

$$ b-c  = \pm(a-b) \\ 
c-a =\pm(b-c) \\ 
 a-b = \pm(c-a) \\ $$

If we had $$b-c=-(a-b)=b-a$$, we would have $$c=a$$, a contradiction, as $$a,b,c$$ are distinct.

Therefore,

$$ b-c = a-b \\ 
 c-a = b-c \\ 
 a-b = c-a \\ $$
 
Thus,

$$ 2b = a+c \\ 
 2c = b+a \\ 
 2a = c+b \\ $$

This is impossible, as plugging in $$2b-a=c$$ in the second equation yields:

$$ 2(2b-a)= b+a \\ 
 4b-2a = b+a \\ 
 3b = 3a \\ 
 b = a  \\ $$

Which is a contradiction. Therefore,  $$P(a) = b$$, $$P(b) = c$$, $$P(c) = a$$ cannot be satisfied simultaneously. $$\square$$
