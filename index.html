              <h2>What is the AMC 10/12?</h2>
                <p>The AMC 10 and AMC 12 are both 25-question, 75-minute, multiple choice examinations in high school mathematics designed to promote the development and enhancement of problem-solving skills.</p>

                <p>The AMC 10 is for students in 10th grade and below, and covers the high school curriculum up to 10th grade.
                    Students in grade 10 or below and under 17.5 years of age on the day of the contest can take the AMC 10.
                    The AMC 12 covers the entire high school curriculum including trigonometry, advanced algebra, and advanced geometry,
                    but excluding calculus. Students in grade 12 or below and under 19.5 years of age on the day of the contest can take the AMC 12.</p>

                <p>These competitions are administered around the country on Tuesday, Feb. 7, 2017 and/or Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017.
                    The AMC 10/12 provides an opportunity for high school students to develop positive attitudes towards analytical thinking and mathematics that can assist in future careers.
                    The AMC 10/12 is the first in a series of competitions that eventually lead all the way to the International Mathematical Olympiad (see Invitational Competitions).</p>

            <h2>What is the difference between the A and B versions of the AMC 10 and 12?</h2>
            <p>Both the A and the B versions of the AMC 10 and the AMC 12 have the same number of questions,
              the same scoring and the same rules for administration. T
              he only differences are the competition dates and that each version has a distinct set of questions,
              although the two examinations are designed to be equal in difficulty and distribution of topics.
              Schools can order one or both versions of the tests, so long as they pay the appropriate registration fee for each competition date,
              and purchase the competition bundles for each date.

            </p>
