I am Jet. This blog is to post any cool math problems I come across, and to write about any math experiences (maybe HMMT, fingers crossed for Ross???)


I am doing this because of [Evan Chen's keeping a blog on the problems you solve](https://usamo.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/writing/), and also it's cool :)
